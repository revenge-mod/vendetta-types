# Vendetta Typings

These are the type definitions for Vendetta plugins running on Revenge.

You can install the package using `npm install https://github.com/revenge-mod/vendetta-types`.

Given you have configured everything correctly, they _should_ work.

However, if they do not, please add the following to the top of your TypeScript file:

```ts
/// <reference path="path/to/node_modules/@revenge-mod/vendetta-types/defs.d.ts" />
```
